        "abstract": "Research that meaningfully integrates constraint-based modeling with machine learning is at its infancy but holds much promise. Here, we consider where machine learning has been implemented within the constraint-based modeling reconstruction framework and highlight the need to develop approaches that can identify meaningful features from large-scale data and connect them to biological mechanisms to establish causality to connect genotype to phenotype. We motivate the construction of iterative integrative schemes where machine learning can fine-tune the input constraints in a constraint-based model or contrarily, constraint-based model simulation results are analyzed by machine learning and reconciled with experimental data. This can iteratively refine a constraint-based model until there is consistency between experimental data, machine learning results, and constraint-based model simulations.",

        "abstract": "Different approaches have been developed for evaluating Sobol\u2019 indices for global sensitivity analysis (GSA). Among them sample-based approaches are extremely attractive because they can be purely driven by data and estimate various Sobol\u2019 indices (e.g., first-order, higher-order, total-effects) for any individual or group of random variables using only one set of samples. However, such approaches usually rely on an accurate density estimation for the interested groups of random variables, which can be challenging for high-dimensional groups. For example, the commonly used kernel density estimation (KDE) suffers from curse of dimensionality. In this regard, this paper proposes a novel knowledge-enhanced machine learning approach for data-driven GSA for groups of random variables using sample-based approach and an emerging generative machine learning model, i.e., normalizing flows (NFs), for high-dimensional density estimation. To facilitate reliable and robust NFs training, a knowledge distillation-based two-stage training strategy is developed. Two customized loss functions are introduced, which are inspired by domain knowledge in the context of sample-based approach for GSA. Two examples are considered to illustrate and verify the efficacy of the proposed approach. Results show that introducing NFs can significantly alleviate the curse of dimensionality in the traditional sample-based approach for GSA and improve accuracy of density estimation and estimation of Sobol\u2019 indices.",

        "abstract": " As the use of machine learning in high impact domains becomes widespread, the importance of evaluating safety has increased. An important aspect of this is evaluating how robust a model is to changes in setting or population, which typically requires applying the model to multiple, independent datasets. Since the cost of collecting such datasets is often prohibitive, in this paper, we propose a framework for evaluating this type of stability using the available data. We use the original evaluation data to determine distributions under which the algorithm performs poorly, and estimate the algorithm\u2019s performance on the \"worst-case\" distribution. We consider shifts in user defined conditional distributions, allowing some distributions to shift while keeping other portions of the data distribution fixed. For example, in a healthcare context, this allows us to consider shifts in clinical practice while keeping the patient population fixed. To address the challenges associated with estimation in complex, high-dimensional distributions, we derive a \"debiased\" estimator which maintains root-N consistency even when machine learning methods with slower convergence rates are used to estimate the nuisance parameters. In experiments on a real medical risk prediction task, we show this estimator can be used to analyze stability and accounts for realistic shifts that could not previously be expressed. The proposed framework allows practitioners to proactively evaluate the safety of their models without requiring additional data collection.",
